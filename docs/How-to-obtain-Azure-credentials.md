# How to Obtain Azure Credentials

## Creating Azure Credentials for Jenkins

1. **Log in to the Azure Active Directory portal**

   * Access the Azure portal and go to the **Azure Active Directory** section.

2. **Register a new application**

   * In the **Overview** tab, click **Add > App registration**.
   * Fill in the application name (e.g., `CI-CD-K8S`).
   * Select the supported account types (usually "Accounts in this organizational directory only").
   * Optionally add a Redirect URI if needed.
   * Click **Register** to create the application.

3. **Obtain essential IDs**

   * Copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** shown in the registered app overview.

4. **Create a client secret**

   * Go to the **Certificates & secrets** section.
   * Create a new **Client Secret** and save the generated value (this will be needed for Jenkins).

And thatâ€™s it! With this, you have the necessary credentials for Jenkins.
