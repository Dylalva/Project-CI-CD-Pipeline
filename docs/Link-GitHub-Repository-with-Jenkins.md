   Navigate to the **Settings** tab inside your repository.

2. **Select the Webhooks Section**
   In the side menu, find and select **Webhooks**.

3. **Add a New Webhook**
   Click the **Add webhook** button.

4. **Configure the Webhook**

   * In **Payload URL**, enter the URL where you want to receive the events (for example, `http://ip-jenkins:port/github-webhook/`).
   * In **Content type**, select `application/json`.
   * Optional: You can add a secret to validate the requests.
   * In **SSL verification**, keep SSL verification enabled (recommended) or disable it if you donâ€™t have an SSL certificate.
